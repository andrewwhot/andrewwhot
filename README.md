## Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

My name is Andrew - I'm a Texas-borne, Texas-educated recent graduate from the University of Texas's MS in Business Analytics program.
My initial trajectory took me through undergrad focusing on psychology/neuroscience research, netting me a handful of years working in lab settings. However, as I neared graduation I realized that where my passions truly lay were in the acts of statistical analysis and data science. This led me to undertaking a one-year program at UT's McComb's School of Business, from which I recently received my Master's of Science in Business Analytics.

While I began my journey into statistical analysis with RStudio in my undergrad years, I added Python to my toolkit with a couple classes of introductory computer science. Both of these languages were further honed in my Master's program, though a majority of the work was done using Python. Additionally, I have experience in using Excel for analytics, as well as database management in SQL and PowerBI / Tableau for visualization.

In my time in both undergrad and graduate school, I've picked up a plethora of analytical methods to apply in business settings. These include:
- Linear / Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (MLP)
- Bagging
- Decision Trees, Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine
- Unsupervised Methods (PCA, t-SNE, ICA, Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM)

Additionally, I have learned a number of optimization tools, such as:
- Linear Programming (Gurobi, Simplex Method, Sensitivity Analysis)
- Integer Programming
- Traveling Salesperson Problems
- Nonlinear Programming (scipy.optimize, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformer Neural Nets, Tensorflow)
- Dynamic Programming
- Reinforcement Learning
- Simulations (multi-armed bandit problems and their solutions)

While I have dabbled, I aspire to learn more and hone my skills in contemporary diffusion model techniques, as well as to stay up to date with the latest and greatest machine learning algorithms. I would love to chat about the state of ML, AI, and more!
